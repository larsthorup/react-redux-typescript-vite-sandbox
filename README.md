# react-redux-typescript-vite-sandbox

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
```

Note: this project currently requires a custom build of `mocha-vite-puppeteer` from this PR: https://github.com/larsthorup/mocha-vite-puppeteer/pull/21

Note: this project was scaffolded with:

```bash
npm init @vitejs/app app -- --template react-ts
```

Note: this project was reimplemented with Vite. The original Create React App-based project is here: https://github.com/larsthorup/react-redux-typescript-sandbox
